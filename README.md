Learning how to use Github properly.

Hello fellow Humans!

It's a wonderful day to learn github from Ann Arbor Michigan. It is 7/11/2020 19:05.
This is my first every trial with using github through the github UI. I hope this
will help me better understand github prior to doing everything in the command line.

After this, I will be committing (saving this edit) to the readme-edit branch. You
will notice right after that the README file in this branch and the master will no
longer be the same until we push it to master.
